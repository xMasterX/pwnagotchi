# What changed in this fork:
* Updated raspbian image
* Fixed image build
* Removed usb0 network to fix RPi 3b support / (usb0 is always UP, so we are entering manual mode in any case)
* [New display drivers](https://github.com/Artanovskaya/pwnagotchi) - `waveshare_3` & `waveshare35lcd`
* New config parameter to invert display color - `ui.display.invert = true`
* AI model loading fix
* RPi 3b wifi channels/region fix
* Other fixes

P.S.
After installing on RPi 3b or later connect to ssh and enter
`rfkill unblock wifi`
`rfkill unblock all`
Also if you using LCD35 clones or waveshare 3.5 lcd
you need to install [driver](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/3.5inch_RPi_LCD_(A)#Method_1._Driver_installation) 
- only clone a drivers repo and run `./LCD35-show lite` other steps are not needed / if you want to rotate screen `./LCD35-show lite 180`

then add this line `echo 0 > /sys/class/graphics/fbcon/cursor_blink` into `/etc/rc.local`

after all maybe you dont want very bright white background on that screen so add
`ui.display.invert = true`
to your config.toml

# Pwnagotchi

[Pwnagotchi](https://pwnagotchi.ai/) is an [A2C](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752)-based "AI" leveraging [bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/) that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either passively, or by performing authentication and association attacks). This material is collected as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/), including [PMKIDs](https://www.evilsocket.net/2019/02/13/Pwning-WiFi-networks-with-bettercap-and-the-PMKID-client-less-attack/), 
full and half WPA handshakes.

Instead of merely playing [Super Mario or Atari games](https://becominghuman.ai/getting-mario-back-into-the-gym-setting-up-super-mario-bros-in-openais-gym-8e39a96c1e41?gi=c4b66c3d5ced) like most reinforcement learning-based "AI" *(yawn)*, Pwnagotchi tunes [its parameters](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/blob/master/pwnagotchi/defaults.toml) over time to **get better at pwning WiFi things to** in the environments you expose it to. 

More specifically, Pwnagotchi is using an [LSTM with MLP feature extractor](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/policies.html#stable_baselines.common.policies.MlpLstmPolicy) as its policy network for the [A2C agent](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/a2c.html). If you're unfamiliar with A2C, here is [a very good introductory explanation](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752) (in comic form!) of the basic principles behind how Pwnagotchi learns. (You can read more about how Pwnagotchi learns in the [Usage](https://www.pwnagotchi.ai/usage/#training-the-ai) doc.)

**Keep in mind:** Unlike the usual RL simulations, Pwnagotchi learns over time. Time for a Pwnagotchi is measured in epochs; a single epoch can last from a few seconds to minutes, depending on how many access points and client stations are visible. Do not expect your Pwnagotchi to perform amazingly well at the very beginning, as it will be [exploring](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752) several combinations of [key parameters](https://www.pwnagotchi.ai/usage/#training-the-ai) to determine ideal adjustments for pwning the particular environment you are exposing it to during its beginning epochs ... but ** listen to your Pwnagotchi when it tells you it's boring!** Bring it into novel WiFi environments with you and have it observe new networks and capture new handshakes—and you'll see. :)

Multiple units within close physical proximity can "talk" to each other, advertising their presence to each other by broadcasting custom information elements using a parasite protocol I've built on top of the existing dot11 standard. Over time, two or more units trained together will learn to cooperate upon detecting each other's presence by dividing the available channels among them for optimal pwnage.
